# Nextflow: Scalable, Sharable and Reproducible Computational Workflows across Clouds and Clusters (EMBL-ABR Nextflow webinar)

>Large analysis workflows are fragile ecosystems of software tools, scripts and dependencies. This complexity commonly makes these workflows not only irreproducible but sometimes even not re-runnable outside their original development environment. Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework and a domain specific programming language which follows the dataflow paradigm and offers an alternative, and arguably superior, approach to developing, executing and sharing pipelines.

>In this webinar we will follow the steps required for developing sharable, version controlled, container-backed workflows, which can be seamlessly executed across different environments from a laptop to cluster to cloud. We will do this by leveraging Nextflowâ€™s integration with code and container image hosting services such as GitHub and Docker Hub, and out of the box support for various HPC cluster schedulers and the Amazon AWS cloud.
