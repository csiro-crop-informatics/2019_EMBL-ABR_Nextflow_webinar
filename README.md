This repository contains information for the EMBL-ABR webinar on "Nextflow: Scalable, Sharable and Reproducible Computational Workflows across Clouds and Clusters" presented by Rad Suchecki on 14th March 2019.

#  Webinar details

**Abstract:**
Large analysis workflows are fragile ecosystems of software tools, scripts and dependencies. This complexity commonly makes these workflows not only irreproducible but sometimes even not re-runnable outside their original development environment. Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework and a domain specific programming language which follows the dataflow paradigm and offers an alternative, and arguably superior, approach to developing, executing and sharing pipelines.

In this webinar we will follow the steps required for developing sharable, version controlled, container-backed workflows, which can be seamlessly executed across different environments from a laptop to cluster to cloud. We will do this by leveraging Nextflowâ€™s integration with code and container image hosting services such as GitHub and Docker Hub, and out of the box support for various HPC cluster schedulers and the Amazon AWS cloud.

**Date/time:** Thursday 14 March 2019 13:00-14:00 AEDT /12:00-13:00 AEST

# Data for the Webinar

For the purpose of demonstrating a Nextflow workflow in reasonable time, we will use the dataset used in [this Snakemake webinar](https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/2019_EMBL-ABR_Snakemake_webinar#data-for-the-webinar).
